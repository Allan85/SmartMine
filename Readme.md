IMPORTANT: 

Before you start mining, go into the Mining\bin folder, then each subfolder and modify the Windows Command Script files (ending in .bat) to match your mining pool accounts.
Only modify the fields after -u and -p for the ccminer folders, and --user and --pass for the ewfb folder.
You may also set a custom intensity using -i depending on your GPU. Most of the time, not specifying intensity works fine.

Also, go into the config.r file in the main directory and follow the instructions there.
Note: it may be easier to edit the file with Notepad++ instead of Notepad.
